# Super Smoothies 

*Awarded Project Excellence Certificate by Code First Girls

This website was created by Shida and me as a collaborative project for the Code First Girls "Introduction to Web Development Course". We used this website to apply the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap skills we learnt through the course. The website provides recipes for smoothies, created by us. This was for both of us the first attempt at collaborating on GitHub. We used branches and pull requests to develop the website and review and approve of each other's code.

## Creating Super Smoothies
1. We used https://moqups.com/ to create a wireframe of the website.
2. Shida designed the website and chose the colour scheme and photos.
3. I created the skeleton of each page, as well as the navigation bar, using Bootstrap, ensuring that the website had responsive design and looked the same on various devices.
4. Shida added content to each page.
5. We worked together at developing consistent styling for each page.
6. I added JavaScript to make the website interactive:
  i. The logo on the top of the page changes on hover.
  ii. Input validation on the contact page works.
